Project Overview:

Prophet is an open source library published by Facebook that is based on decomposable (trend+seasonality+holidays) models. It provides us with the ability to make time series predictions with good accuracy using simple intuitive parameters and has support for including impact of custom seasonality and holidays.

As we have seen Prophet is very powerful and effective in time series forecasting. However, as we mentioned earlier there are a few other forecasting tools.
