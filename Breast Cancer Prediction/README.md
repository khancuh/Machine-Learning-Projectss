Project Overview

Predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant

Attribute Information:

1) ID number

2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

3-32)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)

b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)

c) perimeter

d) area

e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)

f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)

g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)

h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)

i) symmetry

j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.

Missing attribute values: none

Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant
