#First Innings Score Prediction Projects

![first-innings-banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58104706/93117836-09275780-f6dd-11ea-841b-0b030904e488.png)



Project Overview

• Created a model that predicts the score (in terms of range) of IPL matches

• Engineered features ....

• Optimized Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model



Resources Used

• Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn

• Dataset by Shivam Mitra: https://github.com/codophobia/CricketScorePredictor

Data Cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

• Transformed the categorical variables into dummy variables

• Split the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 20%
Model Building

Algorithms used for this project are as follows:

• Multiple Linear Regression

• Decision Tree

• Random Forest

• Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)
Model Evaluation

I have used Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric, and here are the scores:
• Multiple Linear Regression -
• Decision Tree -
• Random Forest -
• Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) -
